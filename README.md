### Statistical Learning for Control

Most of these codes were downloaded from Stefan Schaal's website.

I decided to index them on github because while I was recently doing a paper review, I came across Chris Atkeson's awesome line of work in efficient robust policy optimization. I found that most of the websites listed on his old Georgia Tech homepage were with 404 Not Found statuses. Afraid that Stefan's precious codes might get missing on the web in the future too, I downloaded all his codebases that are publicly available and decided to index them here.

I hope the humble inquirer after knowledge finds them useful. Cheers!
